                                This is a simple little inventory management system I created in my free time. It is part of a larger uncompleted project right now, but stands on its own as a pretty interesting feature.
                                The design of it was very interesting, particularly in figuring out how to handle global coordinates vs local coordinates between the Inventory GUI scene and
                                the global "mouse manager" scene. I had a bug for a while where collisions weren't really working with the inventory cells (hovering over items at the wrong spots on the screen), as a result
                                of this exact issue. Additionally, there was a lot of interesting logic with regards to handling all of the edge cases for inventory behavior. For instance, swapping held item and full cell, putting held item into empty cell,
                                picking up item from empty cell, etc. There were lots of edge cases that weren't easily generalizable. Additionally, there was lots of backend work to do for the Item data structures, as they needed to be able to hold information (such as an item type),
                                to be able to handle behavior such as cells that are restricted to only one type of item (like armor or equipment cells). I ended implementing a JSON reader manager so I could write out all of this
                                item metadata in JSON format and just have it read into my game automatically. This made a lot of the logic behind the scenes much easier, and I'm sure will be a design decision that pays off in the future when
                                I need to write 100's more of these items, each with complex behavior I haven't yet anticipated.

                                I wrote this all in GDScript in Godot 4.0 Beta 8 because I wanted to start learning the new syntax (lots of interesting changes, specifically with
                                regards to object instantiation syntax, which was a big deal on this project since I'm doing a significant amount of it here with the JSON Manager).
