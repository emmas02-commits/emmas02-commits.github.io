                        Hi, thanks for checking out  my portfolio! My name is Emma Simon and I am a current 
                        student studying at the University of Texas at Austin in the CS Department.
                        I am currently looking for Summer 2023 internship work as a Technical Artist at a
                        game company. My primary research focus is in real-time graphics computation. I am
                        very interesterd in shaders, rigging, and designing tools to ensure artists and animators can effectively
                        do their job. Thank you again for checking out my work and feel free to contact me if you have any further questions/interest.
                    </p>
